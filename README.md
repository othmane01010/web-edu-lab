# 🌐 Web Edu Lab

Welcome to Web Edu Lab!

This repository is my personal journey to learn web development step by step using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Each project here is a practical application of what I’m learning, and not a commercial-ready product.

> ⚠️ The repository is fully educational, focusing on experimentation and learning by doing. Each small project helps me understand how web pages work and how users interact with them.
